datastructure 3 query range sum
geometry 3 euclid range vertex
graph 3 query vertex hamiltonian
math 3 hamiltonian sum euclid
consider the hamiltonian graph where each vertex corresponds
to an linear equation we can solve these using the euclid
algorithm now you will receive a query corresponding to a
range of vertices your task is to compute the sum of the
minimum solution of those vertices
